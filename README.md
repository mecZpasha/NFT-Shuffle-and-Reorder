# NFT-Shuffle-and-Reorder

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7vSgTXz/Ads-z.png">

When you make your own NFT Collection through custom art generator such as hashlips ..  <br /> 
Then you wanted to select good combinations from art generator instead of take all outputs..  <br /> 
Then you will have some problem like your picture numbers will be not in the order (1, 2, 3, 4 ..)  <br /> 
instead they will be like (4, 12, 15, 21 ..) because you selected manually.  <br /> 
Their json and their metadatas also will be order like (4, 12, 15, 21 .. ) ( you should have pick and save 4.json for 4.png before )  <br /> 
You can shuffle your collection and re order them with this script and also you can change your entire collection name and description!

Steps:

  1- Upload your pictures  to collection folder  
  2- Upload jsons of their pictures to jsons folder <br /> 
  3- Open main.py and edit your collection name / description <br /> 
  4- Run the script!  <br /> 
  5- Take your new collection from new_collection and new_jsons

Warning:

  1 - When you run main.py with VS or notepads don't forget to open folder first then select to main.py! </br>
  2 - Do not remove "nj" and "nc" files for script works perfect </br>
  otherwise you will be get ERROR!
 
Enjoy the repo!
