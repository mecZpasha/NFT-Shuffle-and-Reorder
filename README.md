# NFT-Shuffle-and-Reorder

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7vSgTXz/Ads-z.png">

When you make your own NFT Collection through art generator such as hashlips .. 
You wanted to select good combinations from art generator instead of take all outputs..
Then you will have some problem like your picture numbers will be not in the order (1, 2, 3, 4 ..)
instead they will be like (4, 12, 15, 21 ..) because you selected manually.
Their json and their metadatas also will be order like (4, 12, 15, 21 .. )
You can shuffle your collection and re order them with this script and also you can change your entire collection name and description!

Steps:

  1- Upload your pictures  to collection folder  
  2- Upload jsons of their pictures to jsons folder <br /> 
  3- Open main.py and edit your collection name / description <br /> 
  4- Run the script!  <br /> 
  5- Take your new collection from new_collection and new_jsons

Warning:

  1 - When you run main.py with VS or notepads don't forget to open folder first then select to main.py! </br>
  2 - Do not remove "nj" and "nw" files for script works perfect </br>
  otherwise you will be get errors!
 
Enjoy the repo!
